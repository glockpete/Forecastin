💡 Actionable Implementation Patterns
Blending Mathematics Enhancement
// Enhanced with learning coefficients
learning_α = base_α * (role_accuracy / average_accuracy)
learning_β = base_β * (sector_accuracy / average_accuracy)
W_learned = norm(learning_α*W_role + learning_β*W_sector + ...)

Prediction Tracking System
Sequential Bayesian updating like pybats
News-based outcome verification with source reliability
Performance tracking with calibration metrics
